NB: this assignment was marked manually. Please let me know if there are any
inconsistencies, and I will try to fix them ASAP.

* Criterion 2: 0.25 (thorough use of Git)
* Criterion 4: 0.8 (Viewer is clear and works well, no display of score or resource state)
* Criterion 6: 1.0 (use of object-oriented backend, but not consistent)

Hi Eliz, Sam and Tom,

Outstanding work with this assignment! Well done for completing all the tasks.
Your use of commenting and Git is also quite good.

Great job with your Viewer, it looks great. Everything is clear, the only issue
I have is that there is no display of resource state or score. The code is also
really well structured, and will make a great base for you to write your solution
to Task 10.

I noticed that there were solutions to certain tasks which created a `Board`
instance and solved the task within this instance, and others that only used
Strings and lists, which were quite long. I would encourage getting in the
habit of using this `Board` constructor (or some other object-oriented approach)
because it will make your code much easier to read. This is especially important
in D2F, where many of the tasks will be more challenging than those in D2C.

As always, if you any questions or concerns about this feedback, you're most
welcome to message me on Piazza or chat with me in the lab. Well done!
